# Contributing

## Submitting a pull request

* Fork and clone the repository
* Install PNPM
* Configure and install dependencies: `pnpm install`
* Create a new branch:
    * `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
    * `git checkout -b fix/my-fix`
* Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
* Make sure your code is correctly formatted:
* Build the project: `pnpm build`
* Push to your fork and submit a pull request
* Wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write tests.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent
  upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
